              <p>cAReeBook is a mobile application built to empower refugee students to study collaboratively. It uses Augmented Reality to visualise posted notes, links and photos on a textbook page, creating a shared study experience. The content provided by peers and by teachers is coupled with the printed or digital textbook and the student will be able to personalize the data relevant in the context of his/her studies.</p>

              <p>We have a mixed team of developers, UX/UI expert, teacher that have a very strong network in the software development community and among teachers in Lebanon. We also want to rely on a network we built in Jordan while working in the RLA program to expand the solution in Jordan.</p>

              <h4>The Idea’s genesis</h4>
              
              <p>While discussing with refugee students in Jordanian universities, they raised a problem they are facing in their first year of university. The problem is the fact that the effort needed to keep up academically and integrate socially is frustrating and huge. The same problem is also faced by refugee students in Lebanon, but when they join high school, since they switch from dedicated schools to integrate in the hosting country schools. The problem is aggravated because there isn't enough teachers to provide the correct supervision and follow up these students needs. The same problem is faced generation after generation, with an effort to pass as much as possible “helping” information from senior to junior students in the same family or geographical network. </p>
              
              <p>When we asked about study habits, the overwhelming majority of high school and university students said they study in the textbook with a smart phone in their hands to reach for additional information. We imagined a mobile application that would use Augmented Reality to overlay helpful information contextually on the textbook. The students will be able to hover their smart phone on a section they didn't understand and then start a discussion or ask questions around it. Other students will be able to upload helpful information like notes, images, links and audio explanations to this section. </p>
              
              <p>When students using the same textbook hover their phone over the same section, they will see small icons localizing the previously uploaded questions and data and they can benefit from that in their studies. Then the students will be able to like the most useful data they found and this will give credit to the students providing the best information.</p>
              
              <p>The teacher will also be able to interfere to stamp some data that is very important or even upload more data. The teacher will be able to provide more exercises or answer questions. This will give the teacher a real view of the concepts that are not well grasped by the students. </p>
              
              <p>All "liked" and teacher stamped data will be available for the student to review before the exams.</p>
              
              <p>The idea makes more sense knowing that all refugees in Lebanon attending the public schools actually study in the same textbook which is very static over years.</p>

              <h4>How it works</h4>

              <p>We are using an Augmented Reality mobile application to enrich printed or digital books. The solution relies on the new capabilities of Augmented Reality platforms made possible recently linking cloud based dynamic data sharing to augmented reality targets. It is heavily pushing for the adoption of augmented reality in mobile devices in the learning experience and more broadly in the categorization of data based on the environment, in this case, the textbook at hand.</p>

              <h4>The plan</h4>

              <p>We have partnered with the Lebanese ASsociation for scientific Research (LASeR), an NGO helping and following up with refugee students in high schools and universities in Lebanon.</p>

              <p>We already performed several user testing sessions with their summer program students to make sure the features of the application and the user experience are aligned with their expectations when studying. We will deploy the application on their mobile phones and start building with them content on a couple of chapters in one book to prepare for a wider user testing and deployment of the application.</p>

              <h4>The Strategy and Dream</h4>

              <p>We want to keep growing this application by building the critical mass of content targeting at first the official books used in Lebanon. In the next 12 months we wish to deploy the application to all refugee students in Lebanon and also to all Lebanese students studying in the same curriculum. We expect the drop out rate of refugee students to be lower. Currently only 1% of eligible refugee students continue through high school in Lebanon and the major reason is the sudden jump in the complexity and learning environment they face when they reach high school.</p>

              <p>Once the application is mature enough within the next 3 years, we will take it to the next level and target all books allowing students from any high school and university to benefit from this application. This can be started in any country where the use of mobile devices is common among students. Our vision is to build an application that within the next 5 years can really transform learning into a collaborative and social task globally, empowering all students to help each others.</p>
