              <h4>Description</h4>
              
              <p>MaktabaTech aims to facilitate the language learning process for refugee children while reinstating their love of reading, by developing an Augmented Reality-based mobile application that brings to life their favorite books.</p>

              <h4>Problem</h4>
              
              <p>Syrian refugees are facing several challenges in their educational journey. One of the biggest challenges is the foreign language burden. In Syria, the educational program is fully in arabic whereas the areas to which the refugees have seeken shelter mostly offer their programs in English or French. This additional layer of difficulty is pushing many refugee learners to drop-out of school or spend too much time and effort translating the subjects to arabic instead of learning the required material. In addition, having insufficient linguistic skills in English is sometimes constituting a barrier to the employment of syrian refugees in host countries, as they find themselves unable to meet the jobs’ requirements when it comes to English proficiency.</p>

              <h4>Solution</h4>
              
              <p>After extensive research and ground visits in Jordan and Lebanon, we have found that it is best to facilitate the language learning process for refugees from a young age, when possible, by offering them accessible resources that complement their daily lives and learning tools: books. That is why, we at MaktabaTech have developed an Augmented Reality based mobile application that complements select Arabic hard-copy books audibly and visually while providing translations to key words. This will make their integration at school, university, and the work environment smoother.</p>

              <p>At MaktabaTech, we focus on three component skills of reading:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Phonological Awareness</b><br>
                  We aim to build the ability of children to recognize the correct pronunciation of keywords, in both their mother language and the language they are learning.  The added audio files trigger the auditory memory and therefore the spelling-reading association.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Word Recognition</b><br>
                  Large and colorful keywords are displayed on screen in order to trigger the visual memory and therefore facilitate the learning of correct spelling and vocabulary. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Reading Comprehension</b><br>
                  We aim to build the ability of children to actively create mental links between simultaneous graphics, animations, word display, and sounds in order to understand the provided information and remember them correctly. 
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>How it Works</h4>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Download the application & Get the book(s)</b>
                  <br>
                  The application is currently available on Android. An internet connection is only required to download the application. The application is designed to work offline without occupying a large space in the device’s memory. You can find pre-selected books that work with the app in local libraries or request them online by contacting us.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Overlay the camera of the device with the illustrations of the book</b>
                  <br>
                  The application works by image recognition. When the camera of the smart device is overlaid with the illustrations of the book, educational content made of animation, audio, and text will be displayed on the screen in both Arabic (mother language) and English (new language).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Validate your knowledge</b>
                  <br>
                  The application offers a validation test after the child has read the book. This evaluates the understanding of the child of the events in the story and the vocabulary learnt in the two languages.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>What we have done</h4>

              <p>Under the MIT Media Lab RLA, we have attended the online workshops, one-week workshop in Amman, and then received funding to further develop and validate our prototype by running user-testing sessions in refugee centers in Lebanon while partnering with the NGO Ana Aqra. All our activities can be found on our website. They include:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Two-day user testing session at refugee learning center of Ana Aqra, Beirut</li>

                <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/maktabatech2.png" /></div>

                <li>User-testing session at the Arc-en-Ciel summer camp, AUB</li>

                <div class="img-container"><img src="assets/maktabatech3.png" /></div>

                <li>User-testing session at the Children Cancer’s Center, Lebanon</li>

                <li>User-testing session at the Collège Sacré-Coeur summer camp, Beirut</li>
